  <h3>What is Webst.ir?</h3>

<p>Webstir is, with any luck, the last bookmark you'll ever need to keep. It is designed to be a repository for all the interesting websites, web apps, content and innovation that is going on today and to help connect people with these tools and sites.</p>

<h3>What stops Webst.ir from being a directory, another bookmark site, or really just a set of links?</h3>

<p>Technically, nothing. But Webstir is organized in a way that I have not yet found on the internet. It is designed to be an ever changing list of websites presented in a way that you'll actually be intrigued enough to click on them. Also, because the website combines crowdsourcing (<a href="http://webst.ir/submit.html">submit</a>) with an editor (<a href="http://bengrandy.info">me</a>), it takes advantage of both of the scope that crowd sourcing can achieve with the quality control that an editor brings.</p>

<h3>How did Webst.ir come to be?</h3>

<p>I am/was a frequent digger and a redditor. One day, I had the idea for something I referred to as Web 3.0 or a site that would be meta-web, so people could submit websites, not content. I left in the morning and by the time I had come back in the afternoon, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/webbit" target="_blank">webbit</a> had been created, I was made the moderator, there were hundreds of comments, I was on the front page of the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/b6cd2/new_ways_to_surf_the_web_and_discover_new_content/" target="_blank">technology subreddit</a>, and have since reached a couple thousand subscribers. Webbit was the beginning of this idea and has been used to seed many of these websites, but I wanted to take it a step further, and offer a website that was specifically designed around this concept.</p>

<h3>What does Webst.ir mean anyway?</h3>

<p>When webbit was created, the name was obvious because of reddit (web+reddit). Reddit's name comes from the idea of re+edit, so many webbit is really web+edit, which I like as well. Webdom (web+freedom, and all the kingdom of the web) was the runner up, which I even made a logo for and everything. Yet, I couldn't get over the fact that it had the word dumb in it. Webstir is a nice pun because it's stirring up the web and it gives credit to Webster, the original creator of the dictionary. And like everything webby, you take something that already exists, and you misspell it.</p>

<h3>What tools are you using for the site?</h3>

<p>I used <a href="http://www.panabee.com" target="_blank">Panabee</a> to find a name. I'm hosting free on <a href="http://pages.github.com" target="_blank">Github</a>, using <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> and the free Spacelab theme from <a href="http://bootswatch.com" target="_blank">Bootswatch</a>. I'm using <a href="http://mac.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub for Mac</a>, and <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2" target="_blank">Sublime Text 2</a>. I learned a lot from <a href="http://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">W3 schools</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> searching, and <a href="http://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>. It's all open source, not for profit, collaborative, etc. (Hey, it's the web, isn't it?!)</p>

<h3>What kind of content can be submitted?</h3>

<p>I try not to limit it, but some company's website, a small blog, a news site, aol- MEH. Are these sites that excite anyone? They key component is innovation, so that can either be what the site is, how it's trying to help innovation, or the content or overall reach of the site in general.</p>

<h3>What about blogs?</h3>

<p>There are so many damn good blogs out there. I don't want to be spammed with every one of them, however if there is something innovative about the blog, or it happens to have a very large captive viewing audience or just great content, <a href="http://webst.ir/submit.html">by all means.</a></p>

<h3>Why is xyz website on the list?</h3>

<p>The final say of any website comes down to me. That said, if you find a website that you think is garbage, inappropriate, or doesn't deserve to be here, please comment in the <a href="http://webst.ir/suggest.html">suggest</a> section.</p>

<h3>You put xyz in the category Q? Wouldn't it make much more sense in P?</h3>

<p>One of the constraints of the current way the sites are organized is they have to fit into a single file tree, and many websites cross over, and thus fall into different categories. That said, I try to keep like things together but if I messed up, you think something should be moved, or a new category made, just mention it in the <a href="http://webst.ir/suggest.html">suggest</a> comment section.</p>

<h3>Are there any sponsored websites or paid placement?</h3>

<p>No. Whenever you bring in the profit motive, the viewer must be skeptical of what they are seeing. This is simply a list of websites that I think are great. If a site seems more like an advertisement for a company that an innovative web site, <a href="http://webst.ir/suggest.html">let me know</a> and I'll delete it.</p>

<h3>Why are you doing this?</h3>

<p>I have spent much of my life on the internet exploring all of its wonder, beauty, laughs, shock, and insight. I would simply like to share these things and help others discover and share them as well.</p>
